# For Project 5 

Notice: In this project, I used ros-melodic edition. So, this project has many packages to support the turtlebot.

## 1.  Localization 

The name of the localization script is *test_navigation.sh*.  You can use the script to location your robot in the map. 

Just input: '<./test_navigation.sh>'
